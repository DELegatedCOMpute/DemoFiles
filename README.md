# DemoFiles

Repo for storing sample Dockerfiles. Includes example node runner.

## Running the demo

Make sure you have `npm`, `docker` and `docker buildx` (not sure if you need buildx but maybe).

Run `npm i` and `npm run start` in this directory to run the demo.

**WARNING**: the demo downloads and compiles redis, and it's kinda hard to stop. It takes like 5 mins on my desktop and can't really be stopped.
